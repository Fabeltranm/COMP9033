    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's lab provides a practical introduction to exploratory data analysis. At the end of the lab, you should be able to use pandas to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load data from a CSV file.\n",
    "- Select data by row, column and cell.\n",
    "- Plot the data.\n",
    "- Compute summary statistics about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are a few things to cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the lab, you will need some previous experience of reading and writing Python code. If you don't have any previous experience of Python, don't worry! This course only requires that you know the basics and these are easy to pick up in a few hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place to start learning is [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). This is a free, interactive, online course and is designed for beginners. You don't have to complete the whole thing - if you stop after Section 8, you will have covered just about everything you need to know for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is the browser-based environment you're reading this text in. Using the notebook is relatively painless, but if you do get stuck, there's plenty of help available in the [official Jupyter Notebook support documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Be sure to have a quick glance at [What is the Jupyter Notebook?](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html), [Notebook Basics](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html) and [Running Code](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html) topics. Each week, labs will be distributed in Jupyter Notebook format, so it's best to get familiar with it as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let's take a quick tour of the notebook interface. To start the tour, click the *Help* menu above and select *User Interface Tour*. When you're finished, take a look at Jupyter's keyboard shortcuts. You can find these by clicking the *Help* menu above and selecting *Keyboard Shortcuts*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's lab involves the use of the Python module `pandas`. Before getting started, you should watch the brief *10-minute tour of pandas* video. You don't need to understand everything in the video to do the lab, but it should give you a good idea of what pandas is and what it can do. To display the video in your browser, click in the cell below and press `Shift`-`Enter`."
