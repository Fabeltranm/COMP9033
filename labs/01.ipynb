    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's lab deals with the computation of basic statistics about data. At the end of the lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute some basic statistics about data.\n",
    "- Plot histograms of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab itself is short but, before we get started, there are a few things to cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the lab, you will need some previous experience of reading and writing Python code. If you don't have any previous experience of Python, don't worry! This course only requires that you know the basics and these are easy to pick up in a few hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place to start learning is [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). This is a free, interactive, online course and is designed for beginners. You don't have to complete the whole thing - if you stop after Section 8, you will have covered just about everything you need to know for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is the browser-based environment you're reading this text in. Using the notebook is relatively painless, but if you do get stuck, there's plenty of help available in the [official Jupyter Notebook support documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Be sure to have a quick glance at [What is the Jupyter Notebook?](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html), [Notebook Basics](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html) and [Running Code](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html) topics. Each week, labs will be distributed in Jupyter Notebook format, so it's best to get familiar with it as quickly as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let's take a quick tour of the notebook interface. To start the tour, click the *Help* menu above and select *User Interface Tour*. When you're finished, take a look at Jupyter's keyboard shortcuts. You can find these by clicking the *Help* menu above and selecting *Keyboard Shortcuts*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The price of gold\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compute some statistics about how the price of gold behaves between 2000 and 2010. Because this is the first lab, we won't worry about how to load the data so let's just use the list below, which contains gold prices (in units of US Dollars per ounce) at the start of each month from January 1st 2000 to December 1st 2010. To load the data into the <tt>gold_prices</tt> variable, click the box below and press `Shift+Enter`."

Because we computed the correlation between our gold price sample and itself, the coefficient is 1 (a sample is always completely correlated to itself).\n",
